## Breakpoints and Media Queries



For this lesson we will be working with Media Queries to conditionally resize our pages based off the size of the devices you are using.


The main code we want to use in our CSS looks something like this:

```
@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {

<-CSS Code goes here ->

}
````

We can change up these values based of what sized devices we are expecting users to use.


## Standard breakpoints and widths

- Large Screen Monitor :  1200px 

- Standard Monitor : 1000px

- Tablet (Landscape) : 800px

- Table (Portrait) : 600px

- Phone (Landscape) : 450px

- Phone (Portrait) : 400px

- Apple Watch : 200px
